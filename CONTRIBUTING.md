## Introduction

The goal behing creating this framework was to add a extra layer of modularization, performance, security, and usability which would help developers around the world on writing small or larger Node.js CLI tools.

## Developers Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. Fork the original repo `https://github.com/supitsdu/climonad.js`.
2. Clone it locally `git clone <your-fork-url>`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`.
4. Make your changes, commit, and push.
5. Open a PR.

### Code Style

Please follow the existing code style (simple, clean, and easy to follow).

- Run linter: `npm run lint`
- Fix linting issues: `npm run lint:fix`
- Format Markdown files: `npm run format`

### Tests

If you're adding a feature or fixing a bug, please add tests using **Vitest**. Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR:

- Run tests: `npm run test`
- Watch tests: `npm run test:watch`
- Check test coverage: `npm run test:coverage`

### Build

Before submitting your PR, ensure the project builds successfully:

    cli.ts                   # CLI entry point
    flags.ts                 # Flag parsing logic
    main.ts                  # Exposes public API
    parser.ts                # Command-line argument parser
    types.ts                 # Type definitions
    usageGenerator.ts        # Usage information generator
    utils.ts                 # Utility functions
