# Quick Start with Climonad.js

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js version 20.0.0 or higher installed on your system.
- **npm (or your preferred package manager):** Make sure npm (or Yarn, Bun) is installed alongside Node.js.
- **Basic JavaScript/TypeScript:** Familiarity with JavaScript or TypeScript is helpful, but not strictly required.

Use your preferred package manager to easily add Climonad.js to your project:

::: code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install climonad
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add climonad
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add climonad
```

```bash [bun]
bun add climonad
```

:::

(or use `yarn add climonad` or `bun add climonad` for Yarn or Bun respectively)

That's it! You're now ready to start building powerful and expressive command-line applications with Climonad.js.
